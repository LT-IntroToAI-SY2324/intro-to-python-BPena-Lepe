# What to complete for this assignment

Some assignments will have coding portions, some assignments will only have project write-ups. There will always be a writeup that you will have to complete in the cloned folder.  You will need to complete these portions in VSCode and push back to github.  I will always help you through that process, if you need it.

For this assignment you will need to complete the following:
1. Follow along with Mr. Berg through the Basics of Python
2. Change the python files as needed throughout, add, subtract, create new files, whatever you need to help understand and complete the python coding challenges
3. Complete `python_basics_writeup.md` by answering all the questions.  Whenever there is a chatGPT portion, only put in the responses if you used them.  It is not mandated to use a generative AI, but it is encouraged.
4. Complete the `unit_1_python_basics.py` file, where you will need to create your own challenge questions and program the solutions.

As always, i will be helping you throughout the process.  We are all at different spots of our programming journey and I want to make sure that we advance throughout.  If you ever need help, or don't understand something, please ask.  Others probably have the same questions.  This is my first year trying out this experiment, so some things will work, and some things will not.  I need the feedback so that I can change as needed.
